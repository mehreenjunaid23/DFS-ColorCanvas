## Description

The project is a Python application program. The program starts by displaying a question box asking the user if they wish to draw a picture and colour it or if they only want to colour. Then if they want to draw an alert message will be displayed stating that if they finish drawing they should close the original window to color. To colour the user has to click on any part of the drawing and a flood fill will colour the drawing till the black borders with randomly generated colour, they can change the colour by recolouring. If they choose to color only they will have to upload a PNG image to color from their device.
